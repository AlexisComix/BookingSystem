                This response may not be the most accurate. In the 
                case where the user has inputted an email address 
                where the domain does not accept email, the user will
                be told that the email is already in use rather than
                the message that is most accurate. It may be too
                much trouble to implement a check for this, for an 
                output that makes the user do the same thing anyway
                (that being, try a different email).

                Signup form uses many types of HTML inputs. There
                are great honking big tables of what each type does,
                but these are the ones needed here. As you will be able
                to see in other templates, there are even widget style
                ones that can be used for datetimes for example.

                Add the required keyword when the input is required. In
                my case, we need everything to be required so that we
                don't get blank entries in the database.
